# Development Environment Setup

The following instructions will help you set up your development for our mob session. It is important that the dev environment is set up PRIOR to the mob session.  
The mob session will likely take several hours and not having the dev environment set up prior will likely add a few more hours.

1. Clone this repo to the place of your choice
  - From the main repo screen, copy the https code for this repo.
  - From command line: cd <destination you wish to store the local project folder>
  - Once you verify you are in the file path that you want: git clone <past https code copied from repo>
  - You will now recieve text from the command line letting you know the objects were recieved.  
2. Download Visual Studio Code (I chose to use Visual Studio Code for Junit integration but other IDEs will work as well). If you choose a different set up, please **verify** it works before the mob!
